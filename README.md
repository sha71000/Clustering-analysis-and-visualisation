This is a data analysis, clustering and visualisation project I have implemented using Pythons data science libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib and Folium libraries. 
<br />
<br />
The project uses K-means clustering algorithm to cluster Toronto neighbourhoods into different groups. The grouping is based on the similarity in venues. Venues could be any entertainment venuw such as museums, bars, cafes, restaurants, ethnic cuisines etc. The subsequent groupings are then visualised on the map using a particular color for particular groups. 
<br />
<br />
The Project leverages FourSquare API for finding the venues. Data sets have been created with the help of wikipedia page and pythons nominatim package.
